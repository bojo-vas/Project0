Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


This project is made to face the requirements of the HarvardX: CS50W "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript" course. It is a personal webpage made by my own design and also fulfilling all the needed criteria’s.
It consist of four .html pages with a double way connection between all of them.
As the file names suggest the “index.html” page is the “front page” of the site, an image and a section with a short message. “about_me.html” shares some personal info with the visitors in section and also includes a picture aside. The “gallery.html” is where I made use of the Bootstrap 4 goods – slightly changing the layout conception and sizing both sections with the grid system and carousel component. Lastly “contacts.html” is a list of links to connect me using different type of platforms – the phone number is not actual to prevent spam and bad usage.
All the pages use common .css file named “style.css” and also some dedicated files for each of them where necessary (all organized in an “all.css” link file). Also a media.css where the media queries are written. Almost all of these files are generated from .scss  SASS files with some variables and nesting included. The .css.map files are also included in the “css” folder.
All the images used are placed within the “images” folder. Most of them are personal.
