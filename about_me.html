            <h3>Early years</h3>
            <p>
                I was born in 1986 in city of Pleven, Bulgaria. Spent all my childhood there with common visits to my mom's village nearby - Varbitsa.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Started my conscious life in a primary school named by saint Clement of Ohrid in my neighborhood. Wasn't the most popular kid though but I really liked it there. After that I went to a "Professional school for electricity and mechanics" (was a really good school back than) and find my best friends there - still keep in touch no mather what.
            </p>

            <h3>Be a firefighter</h3>
            <p>
                After these light-hearted young years I had to leave for a while to Sofia - the capital city of Bulgaria, where I started preparing and learning to be a professional firefighter in the Academy of the Ministry of Interior. But before that just for a "short" nine months I was pretending to be a military as were the rules before going to such kind of institution... still only happy memories when I look back.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was not only hard time though. I had and still have some really good friends and memories from those years. Apart from the well known "high-school" parties and activities I also went on some trips abroad and took part in a lot of events. Maybe this was the time that I started to like those journeys abroad.
            </p>
            <div class="intext right"><img src="./images/ferrari.JPG" alt="Ferrari in Chech Republic"></div> 
            <h3>Getting serious</h3>
            <p>
                So in 2009 I graduated and started working as fire safety inspector in my home town fire service in Pleven. (The Ferrari on the right is not mine just borrow it &#128527;) Fast forward for a few years and now I am a head of the daily shift units for the whole county. And also have to work only once every for days &#128513;&#128540;. 
            </p>
            <h3>But not so much...</h3>
            <p>
                Here we come to this nice amount of free time which I like spending in different ways - bought a motorbike (guess you saw it, it's on the front page &#128526) which I still learn to ride, travel around with my car and girlfriend and also, as I like being at home, recently stared different kind of coding lessons (mostly Python and some minor HTML and CSS so far).
            </p>
            <p>
                That's how we get here - this website is actually my first project for the HarvardX: CS50W "CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript" course. Hope it's good enough and you liked it.
            </p>
            <p>
                So... as good sellers say: Thank you for you time! Hope to see you around soon! And if you like to contact me make a good use of the <a href="contacts.html">"Contacts"</a> section here &#129488. Bye!
