            <h3>Early years</h3>
            <p>
                I was born in 1986 in city of Pleven, Bulgaria. Spent all my childhood there with common visits to my mom's village nearby - Varbitsa.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Started my conscious life in a primary school named by saint Clement of Ohrid in my neighbourhood. Wasn't the most popular kid though but I really liked it there. After that I went to a "Professionall school for electricity and mechanics" (was a really good schoolback than) and find my best friends there and we still keep in touch nomather what.

            <h3>Be a firefighter</h3>
            <p>
                After these light-hearted young years I had to leave for a while to Sofia - the capital city of Bulgaria, where I started preparing and learning to be a proffessional firefighter in the Academy of the ministry of interior. But before that just for a "short" nine months I was pretending to be a military as the rules were before going to such kind of institution... still only happy memories when I look back.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was not only hard time though. I had and still have some really good friends and memories from those years. Apart from the well known "high-school" parties and activities I also went on some trips abroad and took part in a lot of events.
            </p>

            <h3>Getting serious</h3>
            <p>
                So in 2009 I graduated and started working as fire safety inspector in my home town fire service in Pleven. (The Ferrari on the right is not mine just borrow it &#128527;) Fast forward for few years and now I am a head of the daily chift units for the whole county. And have to work only once every for days &#128513;&#128540;.
